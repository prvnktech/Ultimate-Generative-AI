## üìñ Book Overview

Generative AI has grown from a specialized research area into one of the most powerful fields in technology. This book takes readers step by step:

1. **Foundations & Math:**  
   - Probability, statistics, and information theory for generative modeling  
   - Optimization techniques like gradient descent and backpropagation  
   - Concepts such as entropy, KL divergence, and likelihood estimation

2. **Core Models:**  
   - **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: Encoder, decoder, latent space, loss functions  
   - **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Generator vs. discriminator, loss functions, training  
   - **Diffusion Models**: Noise refinement, iterative generation, sampling techniques

3. **Advanced Models:**  
   - DCGANs, Conditional GANs, CycleGANs, StyleGANs  
   - Œ≤-VAE and Conditional VAE (CVAE) for feature disentanglement  
   - Hands-on coding in TensorFlow and PyTorch

4. **Applications:**  
   - Image and text generation  
   - Data augmentation to improve model robustness  
   - Real-world deployment using Docker, TensorFlow Serving, PyTorch Serve, and cloud platforms

5. **Large Language Models (LLMs):**  
   - Understanding GPT architectures  
   - Integrating LLMs into applications with LangChain
